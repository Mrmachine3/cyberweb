      <h1>Welcome to OmniView</h1>
      <h2>We're a startup that has developed a web application that brings the your most meaningful alerts to your immediate attention.</h2>
      <p>OmniView is a "timeline-like" application that displays click-able alerts from various systems, services, and compatible third-party services that are on-boarded onto the event monitoring engine. Unlike applications that have a separate monitoring page, or exportable event logs for individual applications, OmniView ingests various forms of data and uses an Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana (ELK) backend to ingest, index, search, and format alert data that can be displayed in a timeline view.</p>

      <p>Additionally, users can customize the alert displays on a context-by-context basis, meaning that depending on an authenticated users' permissions, profile, and/or event subscriptions, the corresponding context can be triaged automatically by the monitoring engine and escalated to the end-user as defined by the user's preferences, or organization's service level agreements.</p>
